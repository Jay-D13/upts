Prolog interpretor of the language μPTS.

This was a university assignement. The goal was to create an interpretor of the language "μPTS" invented by our teacher.
Sadly I do not have access to the assignement's instructions anymore, which explain the simple language.

I would say this was the hardest assignement I ever had to do. (Teammate would strongly agree)
